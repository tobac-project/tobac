Tracking Output
-------------------------

Tracking outputs a `pandas` dataframe with variables in addition to the variables output by Feature Detection (see :doc:`feature_detection_output`). While this is a separate dataframe than the one output by Feature Detection, it is identical except for the addition of the columns listed below. The additional variables added by tracking, with column names listed in the `Variable Name` column, are described below with units. 

Variables that are common to all tracking files:

   :widths: 3, 35, 3, 3
   :header-rows: 1
