========
tobac provides several analysis functions that allow for the calculation of important quantities based on the tracking results. This includes the calculation of properties such as feature lifetimes and feature areas/volumes, but also allows for a convenient calculation of statistics for arbitrary fields of the same shape as as the input data used for the tracking analysis.
