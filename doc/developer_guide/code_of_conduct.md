# Code of conduct

We are a multi-institutional and international community that aims to maintain and increase our diversity. We acknowledge that we all come with different experiences and capacities. Therefore, we strive to foster an inclusive and respectful environment where we help and support each other. We welcome any types of contributions and believe that we together can create accessible, reusable, and maintanable code that empowers researchers and enables groundbreaking science.

We would like to refer to the [Python code of conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/) as we follow the same principles for communication and working with each other!
