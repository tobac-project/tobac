Code reviews
------------------

Before anything is merged into the release branch (:code:`RC_*`), we require that two reviewers accept the code changes of a pull request. 

============================
How to do a code review 
============================

* Checkout out pull request locally (`how to checkout a pull request locally <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally>`_)

* Run tests locally
  
* Go through code and see if it is readable and easy to understand
  
* Not required, but often useful: test new features with your own data 


============================
Tips and expectations
============================


Doing a code review can be very challenging if you are unfamiliar with the process. Here is a set of documents which might provide a good resource on how to get started:

=========================
Conventional comments
=========================

The comments in a code review should be clear and constructive.

A useful way of highlighting the intention of specific comments is to label them according to `conventional comments <https://conventionalcomments.org/>`_.
