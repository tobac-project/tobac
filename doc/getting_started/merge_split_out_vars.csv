feature,Unique number of the feature; starts from 1 and increments by 1 to the number of features identified in all frames,n/a,int64
cell,Tracked cell number; generally starts from 1. Untracked cell value is -1.,n/a,int64
track,Unique number of the track; starts from 0 and increments by 1 to the number of tracks identified. Untracked cells and features have a track id of -1.,n/a,int64
