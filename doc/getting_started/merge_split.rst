Merge and Split 
======================

This submodule is a post processing step to address tracked cells which merge/split. 
The first iteration of this module is to combine the cells which are merging but have received a new cell id (and are considered a new cell) once merged. 
This module uses a minimum euclidian spanning tree to combine merging cells, thus the postfix for the function is MEST.
This submodule will label merged/split cells with a TRACK number in addition to its CELL number.

Features, cells, and tracks are combined using parent/child nomenclature. 
(quick note on terms; “feature” is a detected object at a single time step (see :doc:`feature_detection_overview`). “cell” is a series of features linked together over multiple timesteps (see :doc:`linking`). "track" may be an individual cell or series of cells which have merged and/or split.)

Overview of the output dataframe from merge_split

d : `xarray.core.dataset.Dataset`

xarray dataset of tobac merge/split cells with parent and child designations.

Parent/child variables include:

* cell_parent_track_id: The associated track id for each cell. All cells that have merged or split will have the same parent track id. If a cell never merges/splits, only one cell will have a particular track id.

* feature_parent_cell_id: The associated parent cell id for each feature. All feature in a given cell will have the same cell id.

* feature_parent_track_id: The associated parent track id for each feature. This is not the same as the cell id number.

* track_child_cell_count: The total number of features belonging to all child cells of a given track id.

* cell_child_feature_count: The total number of features for each cell.


Example usage:
        
``d = merge_split_MEST(Track)``

merge_split outputs an `xarray` dataset with several variables. The variables, (with column names listed in the `Variable Name` column), are described below with units. Coordinates and dataset dimensions are Feature, Cell, and Track. 

Variables that are common to all feature detection files:
