*tobac* can be challenging to use, especially for those not familiar with the Python/SciPy ecosystem. While we strive for robust documentation, this is sometimes not enough or not helpful. We've created this set of pages to help guide you to the best ways to get help. 

We encourage you to look through the [Example Gallery](../examples/index) and the [Frequently Asked Questions](./faqs) pages to see if either of those can help resolve your issue. 

The developers of *tobac*, from the lead developers to individual contributors, want you to have success in your research and in using this package. We **strongly encourage** you to reach out if you encounter any difficulty.
